Of course. Let's elevate the project with a new name and provide a much more detailed, in-depth documentation. This "Director's Cut" blueprint is designed to be a comprehensive guide that you can directly build from, covering not just the "what" but the "why" behind each architectural decision.

### **Project Documentation: Framework Artisan**

*A Fine-Tuned, RAG-Augmented Code Generation System for Specialized Frameworks*

-----

#### **1. Executive Summary & Vision**

  * **Project Name**: Framework Artisan

  * **Vision**: To create a state-of-the-art AI developer assistant that possesses a deep, nuanced understanding of a specialized or proprietary codebase. Framework Artisan will move beyond the capabilities of general-purpose code assistants by leveraging a fine-tuned language model that has been explicitly trained on the target framework's unique syntax, idioms, and architectural patterns.

  * **Problem Statement**: Developer productivity is increasingly tied to the quality of AI assistance. However, teams working with internal, legacy, or niche open-source frameworks operate at a significant disadvantage. General-purpose LLMs lack the specialized knowledge to provide accurate, efficient, or even syntactically correct code for these domains, forcing developers back to manual documentation searches and trial-and-error.

  * **Solution**: Framework Artisan solves this problem by creating a hybrid AI system. It combines a **fine-tuned Gemini 1.5 Flash model** (the "Artisan") for expert-level code generation with a **RAG pipeline** (the "Librarian") for high-fidelity, real-time access to API documentation. This dual-component architecture ensures that the assistant is not only fluent in the framework's style but also factually grounded in its specific implementation details.

  * **Target User Persona**: A mid-level software developer joining a team that uses a fictional Python data mapping framework called **"DataWeave."** They need to quickly become productive without having an expert senior developer constantly available to answer questions.

-----

#### **2. System Architecture & Data Flow**

The core of Framework Artisan is an "intent-based routing" system that directs the user's query to the most appropriate AI component.

**Detailed Data Flow:**

1.  **Query Input**: The user submits a natural language query via the Streamlit frontend (e.g., `"Generate a DataWeave class to map a 'customer' source dictionary to a 'client' target object. The source has 'first_name' and 'last_name', which should be combined into a 'full_name' field in the target."`).
2.  **API Gateway (FastAPI)**: The query is received by the FastAPI backend, which encapsulates the entire AI logic.
3.  **Intent Classification Router (LangChain)**: The query is first passed to a **Router Agent**. This agent uses the base Gemini 2.5 Pro model with a specific prompt to classify the user's intent into one of three categories:
      * `code_generation`: The user wants to write, refactor, or complete code.
      * `documentation_lookup`: The user is asking a specific factual question about a class or method.
      * `conceptual_question`: The user is asking a general "how-to" or "best practice" question.
4.  **Task Execution**:
      * If `documentation_lookup`, the router invokes the **RAG Pipeline**. The query is embedded, and a search is performed against the FAISS vector store of the DataWeave documentation. The raw, relevant text chunks are returned.
      * If `code_generation`, the router invokes the **Fine-Tuned "Artisan" Model**. The original prompt is sent directly to the fine-tuned Gemini 1.5 Flash model, which generates the idiomatic DataWeave code.
      * If `conceptual_question`, the router executes a **hybrid workflow**: It first calls the **RAG Pipeline** to retrieve relevant documentation context. This context is then prepended to the user's original query and sent to the **Fine-Tuned "Artisan" Model**. This gives the expert model the necessary factual grounding to answer the conceptual question accurately.
5.  **Response Synthesis & Return**: The final output (whether a code block, a documentation snippet, or a detailed explanation) is packaged into a JSON object and returned to the frontend for display.

#### **4. Detailed Implementation Plan**

##### **Phase 1: The "DataWeave" Framework & Dataset Creation (Est. 12 hours)**

This is the most labor-intensive but valuable phase.

1.  **Define "DataWeave"**:

      * Create a file `data/dataweave_framework.py`.
      * **Example API**:
        ```python
        # data/dataweave_framework.py

        class SourceField:
            def __init__(self, name: str):
                self.name = name

        class TargetField:
            def __init__(self, name: str, transform_func=None):
                self.name = name
                self.transform_func = transform_func

        class DataWeaveMapper:
            def __init__(self, source_cls_name: str, target_cls_name: str):
                self.source_name = source_cls_name
                self.target_name = target_cls_name
                self.mappings = []

            def add_mapping(self, source_field: SourceField, target_field: TargetField):
                self.mappings.append((source_field, target_field))

            def transform(self, source_dict: dict) -> dict:
                # ... transformation logic ...
                pass
        ```

2.  **Write the Documentation (`data/dataweave_docs.md`)**:

      * Create a detailed markdown file explaining each class, its methods, and providing clear examples. This will be the knowledge source for your RAG pipeline.

3.  **Generate the Fine-Tuning Dataset (`data/finetuning_dataset.jsonl`)**:

      * **Goal**: Create at least 500 high-quality examples.
      * **Example JSONL Entry**:
        ````json
        {"text": "<s>[INST] How do I map a source 'user' dictionary with 'fname' and 'lname' to a target 'person' object with a 'full_name' field? [/INST] To map a source 'user' dictionary to a target 'person' object and combine 'fname' and 'lname' into 'full_name', you can define a transformation function and use the `DataWeaveMapper`. Here is the idiomatic way to do it:\n\n```python\nfrom dataweave_framework import DataWeaveMapper, SourceField, TargetField\n\ndef combine_names(source_dict):\n    return f\"{source_dict.get('fname', '')} {source_dict.get('lname', '')}\".strip()\n\nuser_to_person_mapper = DataWeaveMapper('User', 'Person')\nuser_to_person_mapper.add_mapping(\n    source_field=SourceField(name='fname'), \n    target_field=TargetField(name='full_name', transform_func=combine_names)\n)\n\n# Note: This mapping is incomplete as it only uses 'fname' as a trigger.\n# A more robust implementation might require passing multiple source fields.\n```</s>"}
        ````
      * **Workflow**:
        1.  Manually write the first 50 examples to ensure quality.
        2.  Write a Python script that uses the Gemini 2.5 Pro API to generate more examples. Prompt it with a few of your handwritten examples and ask it to create more diverse and complex scenarios.

##### **Phase 2: Fine-Tuning and RAG Indexing (Est. 5 hours)**

1.  **Fine-Tune Gemini 1.5 Flash**:

      * Use the Google AI Python SDK (`google-generativeai`) to programmatically create and run the fine-tuning job. This is a more advanced approach than the UI.
      * Monitor the job's progress and review the validation metrics (like loss) once it's complete.
      * Save the name of your tuned model (e.g., `tunedModels/framework-artisan-v1`).

2.  **Build the RAG Index (`ingestion.py`)**:

      * Write a script that uses LlamaIndex to:
          * Load `data/dataweave_docs.md` using `MarkdownReader`.
          * Chunk the text using `SentenceSplitter`.
          * Initialize `HuggingFaceEmbedding` with `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5`.
          * Create and build a `FaissVectorStore`.
          * Persist the index to disk.

##### **Phase 3: Backend, Frontend, and Containerization (Est. 8 hours)**

1.  **FastAPI Backend (`api/main.py`)**:

      * Set up your project structure.
      * Implement the LangChain router. You can use a `RunnableLambda` to call the Gemini 2.5 Pro model for the classification step.
      * Load your fine-tuned model using `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="tunedModels/your-model-name")`.
      * Load the FAISS index from disk.
      * Define your `/assist` endpoint with Pydantic request/response models.

2.  **Streamlit Frontend (`frontend/app.py`)**:

      * Create a simple UI with a text area for the query and a "Generate" button.
      * Use `requests` to call your backend API.
      * Use `st.spinner` to show a loading state.
      * Display the response, using `st.code(language='python')` for code blocks.

3.  **Dockerize**:

      * Create a `backend.Dockerfile` and a `frontend.Dockerfile`.
      * Write a `docker-compose.yml` file to build and run both services. Ensure the backend container includes the persisted FAISS index and the `data` directory.

##### **Phase 4: Evaluation and Documentation (Est. 4 hours)**

1.  **Functional Testing (`evaluation/test_code_gen.py`)**:

      * Write a script that defines a list of prompts and corresponding `pytest` tests.
      * The script will call your API for each prompt, save the output, and run the associated test against it.
      * **Example `pytest` test**:
        ```python
        # evaluation/test_generated_code.py
        # This file is dynamically overwritten by the evaluation script
        from data.dataweave_framework import DataWeaveMapper, SourceField, TargetField

        # ... [Code generated by the LLM for a specific prompt] ...

        def test_user_mapping():
            mapper = user_to_person_mapper # Assumes this is generated
            source = {"fname": "John", "lname": "Doe"}
            target = mapper.transform(source)
            assert target["full_name"] == "John Doe"
        ```

2.  **Finalize `README.md`**:

      * Write a professional README that includes the project vision, architecture diagram, tech stack, setup instructions (Docker Compose), and a section detailing the impressive evaluation results.

#### **5. Risks and Mitigations**

  * **Risk**: Low-quality synthetic data leads to a poorly performing fine-tuned model.
      * **Mitigation**: Spend the majority of your time in Phase 1. Manually review a large sample of the synthetically generated data to ensure it meets your quality standards before starting the fine-tuning job.
  * **Risk**: The "Intelligent Router" misclassifies user intent.
      * **Mitigation**: Use few-shot prompting for the router agent, providing it with 5-10 examples of different queries and their correct classification (`code_generation`, `documentation_lookup`, etc.).
  * **Risk**: The fine-tuned model hallucinates or generates non-functional code.
      * **Mitigation**: This is why the evaluation phase is crucial. The `pytest` suite provides a safety net to catch functional errors. The hybrid RAG approach also helps by grounding the model in factual documentation for conceptual questions.

This in-depth documentation provides a complete and professional roadmap. By following these steps, you will create a project that not only demonstrates your technical skills but also your ability to think critically about AI system design, data quality, and evaluation.
